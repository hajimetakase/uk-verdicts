          JUDGMENT GIVEN ON


          15 February 2012

          Heard on 25 January 2012

      Appellant
      Clare Montgomery QC
      Daniel Bayfield
      (Instructed by Lawrence Graham LLP) 	  	Respondent
      Andrew Mitchell QC

      (Instructed by Philip Mobedji, Serious Fraud Office)

          LORD PHILLIPS

   1. This interim hearing has resulted from a tangled web of statutory
      provisions in relation to proceeds of crime. It has been held in
      order to determine whether or not the parties have an absolute
      statutory right to appeal to this court.

   2.   Sections 40 and 41 in Part 2 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002
      ("POCA") make provision for restraint orders over property in
      circumstances where a criminal investigation or proceeding is on foot
      in England and Wales. Section 44 originally made provision for a
      right of appeal to the House of Lords against a decision of the
      Criminal Division of the Court of Appeal in relation to a restraint
      order. Had POCA not provided to the contrary this right would, by
      virtue of section 33(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1968, have been
      subject to the following requirements of section 33(2) of that Act :

              "The appeal lies only with the leave of the Court of Appeal
              or the House of Lords; and leave shall not be granted unless
              it is certified by the Court of Appeal that a point of law of
              general public importance is involved in the decision and it
              appears to the Court of Appeal or the House of Lords (as the
              case may be) that the point is one which ought to be
              considered by that House.

          I shall call these the "leave and certification requirements".

   3. Section 90 of POCA provided, however, that section 33(3) of the 1968
      Act did not prevent an appeal to the House of Lords. It went on to
      give the Secretary of State powers, which included the power to make
      an order imposing, inter alia, leave and certification requirements.
      The Secretary of State exercised that power when, by article 11 of
      the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Appeals under Part 2) Order 2003 (SI
      2003/82) he imposed leave and certification requirements in respect
      of an appeal to the House of Lords under, inter alia, section 44 of
      POCA.

   4. Part 11 of POCA makes provision for compliance with external, ie
      foreign, requests for prohibitions on dealing with property within
      this jurisdiction. Section 444 provides, inter alia, for the making
      of Orders in Council that correspond to provisions in Part 2 of POCA
      in order to cater for such requests.  Pursuant to that section the
      Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (External Requests and Orders) Order 2005
      (SI 2005/3181) ("the 2005 Order") was made. Many provisions of the
      2005 Order corresponded with provisions of POCA. In particular,
      article 11 of the 2005 Order provided for an appeal to the House of
      Lords from a decision of the Court of Appeal in relation to a
      restraint order, mirroring the provision of Section 44 of POCA.
      Article 48(1) mirrored section 90 of POCA, so that absent an order
      imposing leave and certification requirements, there were no
      preconditions to this right to appeal to the House of Lords. No such
      order was made until the eve of this hearing  see para 8 below.

   5. On 25 February 2010 a restraint order was made against the appellant
      ("SIB") by the Criminal Division of the Court of Appeal under the
      2005 Order pursuant to an application by the Director of Serious
      Fraud Office ("The Director") in response to an external request from
      the United States Department of Justice. That order was made in
      substitution for an identical order made at first instance, which the
      Court of Appeal quashed on the ground of non-disclosure. SIB sought
      from the Court of Appeal a certificate that a point of law of general
      public importance was involved in the decision and permission to
      appeal to this Court. The Court of Appeal expressed the view that
      there was no requirement for such a certificate and the application
      for this was not pursued. The Court refused permission to appeal.
      Both the Court and counsel appear to have been under the impression
      that an appeal lay to the Supreme Court, but only if permission was
      given either by the Court of Appeal or by the Supreme Court.

   6. On 24 March 2010 SIB applied to this Court for permission to appeal.
      The respondent ("the Director") applied for permission to
      cross-appeal in respect of the decision of the Court of Appeal to
      quash the original order. At that time, no doubt because of an
      oversight, the statutory provisions that transferred the appellate
      jurisdiction of the House of Lords to the Supreme Court did not
      embrace an appeal under article 11 of the 2005 Order. In these
      circumstances this Court directed that there should be oral
      submissions on two preliminary issues:

              i) Did the right of appeal to the House of Lords under
              article 11 of the 2005 Order survive in the form of a right
              of appeal to the Supreme Court; if so

              ii) Was there a requirement for (a) a certificate from the
              Court of Appeal that a point of law of general public
              importance was involved and (b) leave to appeal?

   7. Since that direction was given, subordinate legislation has been
      passed which has clarified the position. On 6 June 2011 the
      Constitutional Reform Act 2005 (Consequential Amendments) Order 2011
      (SI 2011/1242) came into force. This amended, inter alia, article 11
      of the 2005 Order so as to substitute "Supreme Court" for "House of
      Lords" wherever the latter appeared. It is common ground, rightly in
      the view of the Court, that the effect of this provision is to enable
      appeals to be made to this Court in respect of relevant decisions of
      the Court of Appeal that predate 6 June 2011. The first question
      posed by this Court can thus be answered "it does now". It remains to
      consider whether this right of appeal is subject to a certification
      or leave requirement.

   8. On 19 January 2012 the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (External Requests
      and Orders) Order 2005 (England and Wales) (Appeals under Part 2)
      Order 2012 (SI 2012/138) ("the 2012 Order") was made. It was laid
      before Parliament on 24 January, the day before this hearing. It
      makes the right to appeal under, inter alia, article 11 of the 2005
      Order, conditional upon the leave and certification requirements. The
      2012 Order will come into force on 29 February 2012. It is rightly
      common ground that when it does so it will not apply to the appeal
      with which this hearing is concerned. This is because the Order
      cannot retroactively place restrictions upon the right of appeal that
      currently exists  see Colonial Sugar Refining Co Ltd v Irving 
      [1905] AC 369 at p 372.

   9. For the Director Mr Convey accepted that he could point to no
      provision currently in force that requires the SIB to obtain a
      certificate that a point of law of general public importance is
      involved as a condition of seeking permission to appeal. He did not
      suggest that this was needed. In his written submissions he
      contended, however, that SIB required leave to appeal from this
      Court, leave having been refused by the Court of Appeal. This
      submission was founded on provisions of the Criminal Procedure Rules
      2011 (SI 2011/1709).

  10. Section 446 of POCA provides that rules of court may make such
      provision as is necessary or expedient to give effect to an Order in
      Council made under that Part of the Act. Rule 57.15 of the Criminal
      Procedure Rules 2011 stipulates rules that apply "with the necessary
      modifications" to proceedings under the 2005 Order in the same way
      that they apply to corresponding proceedings under Part 2 of POCA.
      These rules include 71.10. This provides:

                  "(1) An application to the Court of Appeal for leave to
                  appeal to the Supreme Court under Part 2 of the Proceeds
                  of Crime Act 2002 must be made-

                      a) orally after the decision of the Court of Appeal
                      from which an appeal lies to the Supreme Court; or

                      b) in the form set out in the Practice Direction, in
                      accordance with article 12 of the Proceeds of Crime
                      Act 2002 (Appeals under Part 2) Order 2003 and served
                      on the Registrar".    

  11. Mr Convey's point is that it is implicit in this provision that the
      application to the Court of Appeal for leave to appeal that has,
      since 2003, been required in relation to an appeal under section 44
      of POCA, applies equally to the corresponding provision of article 11
      of the 2005 Order.

  12. To this submission Miss Montgomery QC for SIB has the following
      answers:

              i) Rule 71.10 does not purport to impose an obligation to
              obtain leave to appeal from the Court of Appeal. It simply
              provides the manner in which any obligation to seek leave
              takes effect. It cannot be read as imposing an obligation,
              particularly having regard to the requirement  in rule 57.15
              that the rules are to apply "with the necessary
              modifications"

              ii)  In any event the power to make rules is procedural. It
              could not validly be exercised so as to impose a restriction
              on a previously unrestricted right of appeal.

  13. I consider that both these submissions are correct. It would not
      surprise me if those who drafted rule 71.10 were, as were the members
      of the Court of Appeal, under the impression that leave to appeal was
      required. Alternatively they may have anticipated the imposition by
      the Secretary of State of leave and certification requirements.
      Whatever their understanding, however, the rule could not impose the
      leave requirement that, on 29 February, will validly, but not
      retroactively, be imposed by the 2012 Order.

  14. It is for these reasons that this Court declared at the end of the
      hearing that permission to appeal from the order of the Court of
      Appeal was not required.
