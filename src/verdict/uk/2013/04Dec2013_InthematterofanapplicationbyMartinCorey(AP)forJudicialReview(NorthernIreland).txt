      LORD KERR (with whom Lord Clarke, Lord Hughes and Lord Toulson agree)

   1. On 3 December 1973, the appellant, Martin Corey, was convicted of the
      murder of two police officers. He was sentenced to life imprisonment.
      He remained in prison until 26 June 1992 when the Secretary of State
      for Northern Ireland released him on licence, pursuant to section
      23(1) of the Prison Act (Northern Ireland) 1953.

   2. Following his release in 1992 the appellant remained at liberty for
      almost 18 years. On 13 April 2010 the Secretary of State wrote to the
      parole commissioners referring Mr Corey's case to them under article
      9(1) of the Life Sentences (Northern Ireland) Order 2001 (SI
      2001/2564 (NI 2)) and seeking a recommendation on whether the licence
      on which appellant had been released should be revoked. Article 9(1)
      provides that, if recommended to do so by the commissioners, in the
      case of a life prisoner who has been released on licence, the
      Secretary of State may revoke his licence and recall him to prison.

   3. On 14 April 2010, a single commissioner recommended that the licence
      of Mr Corey should be revoked. That recommendation was based on
      material which had been supplied by the Secretary of State. The
      material included a confidential file containing intelligence
      information which had been provided by the security services. After
      that recommendation had been received, a minister of state, acting on
      behalf of the Secretary of State, revoked the appellant's licence on
      15 April 2010. Mr Corey was taken into custody again on 16 April 2010
      and has remained in prison since then.

   4. By virtue of article 9(4) of the 2001 Order, a prisoner recalled to
      prison must have his case referred to the parole commissioners. After
      he had been recalled to prison, therefore, Mr Corey's case was duly
      referred. Initially it was considered by a single commissioner. She
      gave provisional directions under the Parole Commissioners' Rules
      (Northern Ireland) 2009 (SRNI 2009/82). Part of the material which
      had been supplied to the commissioners in April 2010 had been
      certified as confidential information under rule 9(1) of the 2009
      Rules. And rule 9(3) requires that a gist of such information should
      be served on the commissioners and the prisoner.

   5. On 7 June 2010 the Secretary of State provided a dossier of material
      in relation to Mr Corey's case. In compliance with rule 9(3) it was
      accompanied by a statement of evidence which set out the gist of the
      confidential information. This was considered by the single
      commissioner. She also examined the confidential material itself. She
      recommended, pursuant to rule 19, that the Advocate General for
      Northern Ireland should appoint a special advocate to represent Mr
      Corey's interests. The commissioner also recommended that the
      appellant's case should be dealt with by a panel of commissioners,
      rather than by a single commissioner considering it alone. A panel
      was duly convened.

   6. On 9 November 2010, following a directions hearing, the chairman of
      the panel ordered that a statement of all open and closed material
      relevant to the case, including the product of any exculpatory matter
      that undermined the Secretary of State's case, should be served on
      the panel and the special advocate. It was ordered that a similar
      statement in respect of the open material be served on the prisoner's
      representatives. They were not to receive the closed material, of
      course.

   7. A closed hearing took place on 25 January 2011 to consider the
      material which had been served on the panel and the special advocate.
      The panel heard submissions on behalf of the Secretary of State. The
      special advocate also made representations to the panel about the
      adequacy of the disclosure of the closed material. The commissioners
      gave a ruling on these submissions on 7 February 2011. Hearings
      before the panel were then conducted into Mr Corey's case. These took
      place between 29 and 31 March and 23/24 May 2011. Open and closed
      evidence was received. Counsel appeared for Mr Corey and the
      Secretary of State at the open hearings. The special advocate
      represented the appellant's interests during closed hearings.

   8. On 15 August 2011 the panel gave its decision. This comprised both a
      closed and an open judgment. In a detailed ruling which formed part
      of the open judgment, the panel stated that it was satisfied that Mr
      Corey had become involved in the Continuity Irish Republican Army
      from early 2005 and that he was in a position of leadership in that
      organisation from 2008 until his recall to prison. It was concluded
      that the appellant posed a risk of serious harm to the public at the
      time of his recall.

   9. Under article 6(4) of the 2001 Order the commissioners are forbidden
      to direct that a life prisoner be released unless they are satisfied
      that "it is no longer necessary for the protection of the public from
      serious harm that the prisoner should be confined". Since the
      commissioners were not so satisfied in relation to Mr Corey, they
      refused to direct his release.

  10. The appellant sought judicial review of the commissioners' decision
      on the grounds (among others) that inadequate material had been
      disclosed in the gist and that the refusal to direct his release had
      been based solely or to a decisive degree on the closed material and
      was, on that account, in breach of Mr Corey's rights under article
      5(4) of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights
      and Fundamental Freedoms. The Secretary of State was a notice party
      to the application for judicial review.

  11. In a judgment delivered on 9 July 2012, Treacy J held that the
      commissioners' decision was indeed based solely or decisively on the
      closed material. He further found that the allegations contained in
      the open material were not sufficiently specific to enable the
      appellant to provide his lawyers and the special advocate with
      information to refute them. The hearing which the commissioners had
      conducted into the appellant's case constituted, on that account, a
      breach of the appellant's "right to procedural fairness" under
      article 5(4) of the Convention.

  12. Instead of quashing the decision of the commissioners, however,
      Treacy J decided, pursuant to section 21 of the Judicature (Northern
      Ireland) Act 1978, to remit the matter to them with a direction that
      they reconsider the case and reach a decision in accordance with his
      ruling. The judge also decided to admit the appellant to bail pending
      reconsideration of his case by the parole commissioners. The
      Secretary of State immediately applied for a stay of Treacy J's order
      and within a short time thereafter lodged an appeal against the
      judge's decision. Although the commissioners also lodged an appeal,
      this was not pursued and they participated as a notice party in the
      appeal proceedings brought by the Secretary of State.

  13. The Court of Appeal convened an early hearing to consider that part
      of the judge's order by which he had directed the appellant's
      release. On 11 July 2012 it decided that the judge did not have power
      to grant bail. The Court of Appeal therefore stayed enforcement of
      that part of Treacy J's order which had admitted the appellant to
      bail. Delivering the judgment of the court, Morgan LCJ said that the
      determining issue was whether there had been "a break between the
      sentence [of life imprisonment] and the continued detention of the
      [appellant]" (para 8). Since there was no such break, the judge did
      not have power to grant bail.

  14. An application for permission to appeal the decision of the Court of
      Appeal on the question of the High Court's jurisdiction to grant bail
      was lodged with this court on 27 September 2012. Permission to appeal
      was granted on 13 December 2012. In the meantime, the appeal by the
      Secretary of State against that part of Treacy J's decision in
      relation to the breach of article 5(4) (which had been deferred in
      July 2012) was heard by the Court of Appeal on 26 October and 26
      November 2012. In a judgment delivered on 21 December 2012 the appeal
      was allowed: [2012] NICA 57. The Court of Appeal concluded that the
      material provided to the appellant and his advisers was sufficient to
      allow him to give effective instructions to those representing him.
      There was therefore no breach of article 5(4) of the Convention.

  15. Application was made to this court for permission to appeal the Court
      of Appeal's decision on the issue of breach of article 5(4). That
      application was refused. In these circumstances, the appellant's
      appeal on the question whether the High Court had an inherent
      jurisdiction to grant him bail or otherwise order his interim release
      is, strictly speaking, academic. Because of the importance of the
      issue, however, this court considered that the appellant's appeal on
      this question should be allowed to proceed.

      The appellant's arguments

  16. Ms Quinlivan QC made three principal arguments on behalf of the
      appellant. Firstly, she submitted that, when determining a judicial
      review challenge to the commissioners' refusal to release a recalled
      prisoner, the High Court had power to order the discharge of the
      prisoner as part of its inherent jurisdiction. Secondly, she argued
      that the Human Rights Act 1998 afforded an applicant whose Convention
      rights were found to have been violated the right to an effective
      remedy. Where breach of the appellant's article 5(4) rights had
      occurred, the effective remedy for that breach must include
      entitlement to be admitted to bail. Finally, she contended that the
      continued detention of the appellant some two years and three months
      after revocation of his licence, without there having been an article
      5(4) compliant hearing at which the legal propriety of his detention
      was reviewed, amounted to a breach of article 5(1) of the Convention;
      alternatively, his continued detention was arbitrary. In either
      event, the High Court had power to direct that the appellant should
      be released.

  17. The third and final of these arguments had not been addressed to
      Treacy J. Nor had it been  at least in the terms in which it is now
      made  advanced to the Court of Appeal. Article 5(1) of the
      Convention, in its material part, provides that "Everyone has the
      right to liberty and security of person. No one shall be deprived of
      his liberty save in the following cases and in accordance with a
      procedure prescribed by law: (a) the lawful detention of a person
      after conviction by a competent court " For the first time before
      this court, Ms Quinlivan sought to argue that the delay in holding an
      article 5(4) compliant inquiry into the appellant's detention had
      rendered that detention unlawful.

      The inherent jurisdiction of the High Court of Northern Ireland

  18. The Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Ireland) 1877 (40 & 41 Vict c
      57) replaced the existing court structure in Ireland. It created a
      Supreme Court of Judicature which comprised a High Court of Justice
      and a Court of Appeal. The 1877 Act replicated the reform of the
      courts of England and Wales under the Judicature Acts of 1873 and
      1875. As in England and Wales, the High Court in Ireland inherited
      the same inherent jurisdiction as had been enjoyed by the pre-1877
      superior courts of common law and equity.

  19. The Government of Ireland Act 1920 abolished the Supreme Court of
      Judicature which had been created by the 1877 Act. Separate High
      Courts for Northern Ireland and the remainder of the island of
      Ireland (later to become the Republic of Ireland) were brought into
      existence. They continued to function in much the same way as
      previously but as separate entities. In Northern Ireland a new
      Supreme Court of Judicature was created by the Judicature (Northern
      Ireland) Act 1978. Under this Act, the basic court structure remained
      largely unchanged. In particular, the general jurisdiction of the
      High Court was preserved. Section 16(2)(a) provided that all such
      jurisdiction as was capable of being exercised previously by the High
      Court of Justice in Northern Ireland would continue to be
      exercisable. There can be no doubt, therefore, that the Northern
      Ireland High Court has an inherent jurisdiction.

      The nature of inherent jurisdiction

  20. Sir Jack Jacob in his authoritative work, "The inherent jurisdiction
      of the Court" [1970] CLP 23, 25-27 has said that the historical
      development of inherent jurisdiction has proceeded along two paths,
      firstly by way of punishment for contempt of court and secondly as a
      means of regulating the practice of the court and preventing abuse of
      its process. On the latter aspect, Sir Jack said that "the essential
      character of a superior court of law necessarily involves that it
      should be invested with a power to maintain its authority and to
      prevent its process being obstructed and abused".

  21. The power to control the court's proceedings and process has a number
      of aspects: the regulation of proceedings; dealing with abuse of
      process; and compelling observance of the court's orders and
      directions. Ultimately, however, these are geared to the same aim 
      viz ensuring the effective delivery and enforcement of the court's
      decisions. Approached in that way, the issue in the present case can
      be expressed thus: 'Is it necessary for the effective disposal of the
      appellant's claim that the court should have power to order his
      release pending reconsideration of his case by the commissioners?'

  22. The fact that the release of life sentence prisoners is governed by
      the 2001 Order does not, per se, inhibit the exercise of an inherent
      jurisdiction. As Sir Jack Jacob put it, at p 24, "the court may
      exercise its inherent jurisdiction even in respect of matters which
      are regulated by statute". But he added an important rider. Recourse
      to an inherent jurisdiction, he said, must not contravene any
      statutory provision. One may go further, however. Using an inherent
      jurisdiction in a way that runs counter to the purpose or spirit of
      legislation is not permissible. The present case exemplifies the
      point. It could not be right to purport to exercise an inherent
      jurisdiction in a way that would undermine the intended operation of
      the statute. And therefore to direct the release of a recalled
      prisoner where the statutory safeguards surrounding a decision to
      restore liberty to such a prisoner are not in place could not be
      justified by invoking the inherent jurisdiction.

      Did the High Court have inherent jurisdiction to grant bail in this
      instance?

  23. The gravamen of the appellant's case on this question was that the
      common law in relation to inherent jurisdiction is both flexible and
      versatile. It can and should respond to changing needs and
      circumstances. Although it was primarily a means of controlling
      procedure, it should be adapted to meet the requirement of ensuring
      that the court's decision is fully effective.

  24. This argument has as its corollary the claim that, to be effective,
      the remedy for the breach of a recalled prisoner's article 5(4)
      rights must include the opportunity to seek from the court his
      release from prison in vindication of the right. Article 5(4)
      provides:

          "Everyone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention
          shall be entitled to take proceedings by which the lawfulness of
          his detention shall be decided speedily by a court and his
          release ordered if the detention is not lawful."

  25. It is important to recall that in the present case, the lawfulness of
      the appellant's detention on foot of his recall to prison was not
      directly in issue in the judicial review proceedings before Treacy J.
      The focus of the appellant's challenge was to the commissioners'
      failure to direct his immediate release and the manner in which their
      determination was made. The appellants had not made a substantive
      challenge to the lawfulness of his detention under article 5(1) of
      the Convention. As the judge said in para 58 of his judgment:

          "This court is concerned only with the fairness of the
          determination and the process used to come to it " (emphasis
          added)

  26. The decision to grant bail in the present case was not founded,
      therefore, on the conclusion that the appellant's detention was
      unlawful. The judge did not address that issue. He based his decision
      on the manner in which the commissioners' review of the appellant's
      case had been conducted. The claim that the court had inherent
      jurisdiction to order his release must be viewed against that
      backdrop. The same applies to the claim that the finding of a breach
      of article 5(4), to be practical and effective, required that the
      court should be able to order the appellant's release. Put shortly,
      the critical question is whether it was necessary that, in order to
      give meaningful and realistic effect to the finding that the review
      into the appellant's detention had not been conducted lawfully, the
      court should have power to order the appellant's release.

  27. In my view it is clear that the judge's decision did not require that
      underpinning. His order that the review of the appellant's detention
      had not been conducted lawfully and that it should be reconsidered
      was, on its own terms, a full vindication of the right which the
      appellant had asserted. On that ground alone, I consider that the
      judge did not have power to order the appellant's release. That
      conclusion makes it unnecessary to deal with the submission made on
      behalf of the appellant that the decision in Ex parte Blyth [1944] KB
      532, that the High Court did not have jurisdiction to grant bail post
      conviction, should not be followed.

  28. Ms Quinlivan had relied on the decisions in R v Secretary of State
      for Home Department, Ex p Turkoglu [1998] QB 398 and R (Sezek) v
      Secretary of State for the Home Department [2002] 1 WLR 348 in
      support of the claim that a more expansive approach to the scope of
      inherent jurisdiction was warranted. In Turkoglu the applicant had
      been granted bail by a High Court judge when he was given leave to
      apply for judicial review of the decision refusing him leave to enter
      the United Kingdom. His application for judicial review was
      subsequently dismissed and the judge, considering that he had no
      further jurisdiction in the matter, refused bail pending an appeal.
      On his appeal against the refusal of bail it was held that, unless
      there was statutory provision or judicial precedent to the contrary,
      the High Court seized of a civil matter had jurisdiction to grant
      bail. In Sezek the applicant, a Turkish national, had been granted
      indefinite leave to remain in the United Kingdom but his subsequent
      application for British citizenship had been refused for failing to
      declare previous criminal convictions. A deportation order was made
      in April 1999 which included authorisation for his detention. He
      applied for judicial review of that decision which was dismissed. He
      appealed the dismissal and applied to the Court of Appeal for bail
      pending the hearing of his appeal. It was held that the High Court
      had power in judicial review proceedings to make an ancillary order
      temporarily releasing on bail an applicant detained pursuant to the
      Immigration Act 1971. The Court of Appeal, it was decided, also had
      power to order the appellant's release by virtue of section 15(3) of
      the Supreme Court Act 1981 but, in that instance, the court was
      exercising an original jurisdiction.

  29. These cases, Ms Quinlivan argued, illustrated the versatility of the
      law and its responsiveness to the requirements of the liberty of the
      individual. A similar approach was, she suggested, appropriate in
      this case.

  30. It should be noted, firstly, that in both Turkoglu and Sezek it was
      accepted by the Secretary of State that the relevant courts had power
      to grant bail. It should also be remembered that in Sezek the Court
      of Appeal considered that it was by recourse to an original, as
      opposed to inherent, jurisdiction, that the grant of bail might be
      made. All that aside, the principal difficulty with Ms Quinlivan's
      argument is that in both cases the applicants were asserting their
      right to liberty. If their claims were upheld, they were entitled not
      to be detained, whereas what Mr Corey claims is the right to have his
      valid recall to prison reviewed in a way that is compliant with
      article 5(4) of the Convention. A power to grant bail ancillary to
      the declaration that the appellant was entitled to that particular
      form of relief was not only unnecessary in order to make the grant of
      relief practical and effective, it was unrelated to it.

  31. Quite apart from the inaptness of recourse to an inherent
      jurisdiction for the purpose of making the judge's order practically
      and meaningfully effective, to recognise an inherent jurisdiction to
      order release in the circumstances of this case would run directly
      counter to the operation of the 2001 Order. One of the principal
      philosophies underlying the Order is expressed in article 6(4) which
      provides:

          "The Commissioners shall not give a direction [that the prisoner
          should be released] unless-

          (a) 

          (b) the Commissioners are satisfied that it is no longer
          necessary for the protection of the public from serious harm that
          the prisoner should be confined."

  32. That philosophy has received the endorsement of the court in
      Strasbourg. In Stafford v United Kingdom (2002) 35 EHRR 32, para 80
      the European Court of Human Rights said "Once the punishment element
      of the sentence (as reflected in the tariff) has been satisfied, the
      grounds for the continued detention, as in discretionary life and
      juvenile murderer cases, must be considerations of risk and
      dangerousness ". A statement to like effect is to be found in the
      later case of von Bülow v United Kingdom (2004) 39 EHRR 16, para 43.

  33. As Mr Simpson QC for the Secretary of State reminded us, the 2001
      Order prominently required, in article 3(2), that a miscellany of
      experts drawn from a variety of fields be appointed to be life
      sentence commissioners (the predecessors of parole commissioners).
      That requirement was replicated in later legislation. Under paragraph
      1 of Schedule 4 to the Criminal Justice (Northern Ireland) Order 2008
      (SI 2008/1216) the Secretary of State is enjoined to ensure that at
      least one of the commissioners is a person who holds or has held
      judicial office; one must be a medical practitioner who is a
      psychiatrist; one a chartered psychologist; one who has experience of
      working with victims of crime; and one who has made a study of the
      causes of delinquency or the treatment of offenders. This requirement
      reflects the need to have available a range of specialists who can
      contribute to what must often be a difficult debate as to whether the
      rigorous test set out in article 6(4)(b) is satisfied. It would be
      inconsistent with the protection of the public (which is such a
      central feature of the legislation) that a judge should order the
      release of a life sentence prisoner by reason only of a failure to
      conduct an article 5(4) compliant review, where the intense
      examination, contemplated by article 6(4)(b), of whether his
      detention is no longer necessary has not taken place. Put simply, the
      legislature has placed in the hands of a panel of experts the
      difficult decision as to when a life sentence prisoner should be
      released. Their role should not be supplanted by a judge who does not
      have access to the range of information and skills available to the
      commissioners. In this connection it should be noted that Ms
      Quinlivan sensibly accepted that, even if the High Court had inherent
      jurisdiction to release a life sentence prisoner on bail, it should
      not do so unless satisfied that he would pose no risk of serious harm
      to the public.

      The hearing before the Court of Appeal

  34. It appears that the case for the appellant in the Court of Appeal
      took a distinctly different turn from that which had been presented
      to Treacy J. In para 5 of his ex tempore judgment delivered on 11
      July 2012, Morgan LCJ observed that the court had been "referred to
      extensive authorities in relation to the lawfulness of the detention
      of the [appellant]". So far as one can tell from the understandably
      brief judgment, the focus seems no longer to have been on whether
      there had been a review of the appellant's detention that was
      compliant with article 5(4) of the Convention but on whether his
      detention had become unlawful because of "a break between the
      sentence and the continued detention" (para 8).

  35. In deciding that there was no such break the Court of Appeal
      considered the decision of the House of Lords in R (James) v
      Secretary of State for Justice (reported as R (Walker) v Secretary of
      State for Justice (Parole Board intervening) [2010] 1AC 553). That
      case was concerned with indeterminate sentences for public protection
      (IPP) which had been introduced by section 225 of the Criminal
      Justice Act 2003. Such sentences comprise a tariff period (which must
      be served before the prisoner is considered for release by the Parole
      Board) and a post tariff period which ends when the Parole Board
      concludes that it would no longer be dangerous for the prisoner to be
      released.

  36. There had been a systemic failure to provide courses for the
      prisoners in the James case. It was argued that, if they had
      completed such courses successfully, they could have demonstrated to
      the Parole Board their suitability for release. Among other claims,
      the appellants asserted that they were, in consequence, unlawfully
      detained under article 5(1) of the Convention. It was unanimously
      held that the absence of material to enable the Parole Board to form
      a view as to the safety of the appellants' release did not make their
      detention unlawful. Relying on the decision of the Strasbourg court
      in Weeks v United Kingdom (1988) 10 EHRR 293' para 42, the House of
      Lords held that, for a prisoner's detention to be justified under
      article 5(1), there had to be "sufficient causal connection" between
      his conviction and the deprivation of liberty: [2010] 1AC 553, para
      38. Such a link, the House held, might be broken by a prolonged
      failure to enable the prisoner to demonstrate that he was safe for
      release but the delay in the appellants' case was not such as to give
      rise to a breach of article 5(1).

  37. This was the burden of the two principal opinions given by Lord Brown
      of Eaton-under-Heywood and Lord Judge CJ. In para 42, Lord Brown
      considered whether the objectives of an IPP included not only the
      continued detention of the prisoner until he could be safely released
      but also his reform and rehabilitation. At para 49 he said that the
      IPP legislation went no further than providing the government with
      the opportunity to introduce treatment courses but the provision of
      rehabilitative treatment necessary to obviate the risk was not among
      the specific legislative objectives. If it was not possible to assess
      the prisoner's dangerousness because he had been unable to undertake
      courses which might demonstrate that he no longer posed a risk to the
      public "detention beyond the tariff period is justified because the
      sentencing court decided that the prisoner would continue to be
      dangerous at the expiry of the punitive element of the sentence; the
      necessary predictive judgment will have been made." (para 50)

  38. Lord Judge was also of the view that the purposes of the 2003 Act did
      not include the rehabilitation of prisoners (see para 126). He
      expressed the same opinion as Lord Brown as to the enduring effect of
      the decision on dangerousness made by the trial judge at the time of
      sentencing. At para 103 he said:

          "As the court is required to make an informed predictive
          assessment at the date of sentence, and the justification for
          detention beyond the tariff period is found in the judgment of
          the court that an IPP is indeed necessary, I respectfully
          disagree with the views expressed by Laws LJ in the Divisional
          Court in R (Wells) v Parole Board [2008] 1 All ER 138, para 46
          that what he described as 'further detention' after the expiry of
          the tariff period was

              'not at all justified by or at the time of sentence, for the
              very reason that the extent to which, or the time for which,
              the prisoner will remain a danger is unknown at the time of
              sentence ... The justification for detention during the
              tariff period is of course spent; it is spent the moment the
              tariff expires.'

      For the same reasons I am unable to accept the observations of Moses
      LJ in R (Lee) v Secretary of State for Justice in the Administrative
      Court [2008] EWHC 2326, para 22, no doubt reflecting the earlier
      judgment of Laws LJ, that 'the position of a prisoner whose level of
      dangerousness cannot be ascertained is the same as one who ceases to
      be a danger. The original justification for the sentence, namely his
      dangerousness, has ceased to exist'. In my judgment detention beyond
      the tariff period is justified just because the sentencing court has
      decided that the prisoner would continue to be dangerous at the
      expiry of the punitive element of the sentence. The necessary
      predictive judgment will have been made."

  39. On one view the opinions of Lord Brown and Lord Judge as expressed in
      these passages suggest that the judgment, made at the time of
      sentencing that an IPP was required in order to protect the public,
      was not to be dislodged and remained fully effective until displaced
      by positive evidence, accepted by the Parole Board, that this was no
      longer the position. On that view, the circumstance that courses
      (which were the only means by which the prisoner might demonstrate
      his lack of dangerousness) had not been provided was neither here nor
      there.

  40. A softening of such a rigid stance can be detected, however, in other
      passages from the speeches of Lord Hope of Craighead, Lord Brown and
      Lord Judge. At para 51 Lord Brown said this:

          "In my opinion, the only possible basis upon which article 5(1)
          could ever be breached in these cases is that contemplated by the
          Court of Appeal [2008] 1 WLR 1977, paras 61, 69 of their judgment
           namely after 'a very lengthy period' without an effective
          review of the case. The possibility of an article 5(1) breach on
          this basis is not, I think, inconsistent with anything I said
          either in R (Noorkoiv) v Secretary of State for the Home
          Department [2002] 1 WLR 3284 or in R (Cawser) v Secretary of
          State for the Home Department [2004] UKHRR 101. Cawser, it is
          important to appreciate, was a case all about treating the
          prisoner to reduce his dangerousness, rather than merely enabling
          him to demonstrate his safety for release. To my mind, however,
          before the causal link could be adjudged broken, the Parole Board
          would have to have been unable to form any view of dangerousness
          for a period of years rather than months. It should not, after
          all, be forgotten that the Act itself provides for two-year
          intervals between references to the Parole Board."

  41. And at para 15 Lord Hope had said this:

          "It is just possible to conceive of circumstances where the
          system which the statutes have laid down breaks down entirely,
          with the result that the Parole Board is unable to perform its
          function at all. In that situation continued detention could be
          said to be arbitrary because there was no way in which it could
          be brought to an end in the manner that the original sentence
          contemplated."

  42. At para 128 Lord Judge echoed the remarks of Lord Brown quoted at
      para 40 above when he said:

          "I should perhaps add that, like Lord Brown, I should not exclude
          the possibility of an article 5(1) challenge in the case of a
          prisoner sentenced to IPP and allowed to languish in prison for
          years without receiving any of the attention which both the
          policy and the relevant rules, and ultimately common humanity,
          require."

      James v United Kingdom

  43. When the Court of Appeal gave judgment in the present case, the House
      of Lords' decision in James was the most recent judicial
      pronouncement on whether a failure to provide courses by which
      prisoners might demonstrate their suitability for release could give
      rise to a breach of article 5(1). Two months after the Court of
      Appeal ruling, the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) handed down
      its judgment in James v United Kingdom (2013) 56 EHRR 12. The court
      did not agree with the finding of the House of Lords that the
      purposes of the 2003 Act did not include the rehabilitation of
      prisoners. At para 209 of its judgment the court said:

          "The court is  satisfied that in cases concerning indeterminate
          sentences of imprisonment for the protection of the public, a
          real opportunity for rehabilitation is a necessary element of any
          part of the detention which is to be justified solely by
          reference to public protection. In the case of the IPP sentence,
          it is in any event clear that the legislation was premised on the
          understanding that rehabilitative treatment would be made
          available to those prisoners on whom an IPP sentence was imposed,
          even if this was not an express objective of the legislation
          itself. Indeed, this premise formed the basis upon which a breach
          of the Secretary of State's public law duty was found and
          confirmed (see paras 31, 104 and 107 above).The court accordingly
          agrees with the applicants that one of the purposes of their
          detention was their rehabilitation."

  44. Since the applicants in James did not have the opportunity to embark
      on rehabilitative courses, successful completion of which was
      indispensable to their establishing their suitability for release,
      their continued detention was found to be arbitrary. Significantly at
      para 221 the court said this:

          " following the expiry of the applicants' tariff periods and
          until steps were taken to progress them through the prison system
          with a view to providing them with access to appropriate
          rehabilitative courses  their detention was arbitrary and
          therefore unlawful within the meaning of article 5(1)1 of the
          Convention."

  45. The arbitrariness (and, on that account, the unlawful nature) of the
      continued detention stemmed from their detention while the means of
      bringing it to an end remained elusive for the prisoners. This was
      not directly related to the question of the causal link between the
      detention and the original sentence, however. The causal link
      survived. The sentence was imposed because of the perception that the
      prisoners posed a threat to the public if released. (The perception
      was grounded, at least to a certain extent, on a presumption built
      into the statute but it is unnecessary for present purposes to go
      into that). Until the risk of danger to the public could be dispelled
      the causal link with that part of the sentence which required the
      detention of the prisoner remained intact. It was because there was
      no means of ascertaining whether the danger had dissipated that the
      detention had become arbitrary.

  46. Logically, therefore, so soon as a means of assessing the risk of
      danger to the public became available through the courses which the
      prisoner was able to undertake, in order to demonstrate that he no
      longer constituted such a danger, the detention was no longer to be
      regarded as arbitrary. Thus, the court said in para 221 that "until
      steps were taken to progress [the prisoners] through the prison
      system" (emphasis added) with a view to enabling them to undertake
      courses that would reduce or eliminate the danger that they presented
      and until, thereby, they were able to demonstrate their suitability
      for release, their detention remained arbitrary. When the necessary
      steps were taken, detention which had until then been arbitrary, was
      no longer so.

  47. This analysis stands apart from the question of the causal link
      between the original sentence and the reasons for continued
      detention. The original sentence is premised on the existence of a
      danger to the public which must be extinguished before release is to
      be ordered. Until that extinguishment can be demonstrated, the
      reasons for the original sentence (and therefore the causal link)
      endure. But if one deprives the prisoner of the opportunity to show
      that the danger no longer obtains the detention is arbitrary, not
      because the causal link does not continue, but because the prisoner
      cannot show that the risk on which it is founded is no longer
      present.

  48. The lawfulness of the appellant's detention is not to be approached,
      therefore, solely in terms of whether the causal link between his
      original sentence and his current detention has been broken. The
      essential question is whether he has had an opportunity to
      demonstrate that the reasons that he was considered to present a
      threat to society no longer apply. If he does not have such an
      opportunity, then clearly, on the authority of James v United Kingdom
      , his continued detention is arbitrary. Whether it follows that he
      must, therefore, be released is an altogether different question.

  49. In the present case it is clear that the appellant did indeed have an
      opportunity to show that he no longer posed a risk to the public. The
      Court of Appeal's judgment dismissing his claim that the review of
      his detention was not compliant with article 5(4) disposes
      conclusively of that issue. He has had what has been found to be a
      fully ample chance to show that he can be safely released. There is,
      therefore, no question of his continued detention being arbitrary.
      Moreover, the review of the panel's decision, foreshadowed in their
      ruling, is already under way and we were informed in the course of
      the hearing that this is likely to be completed soon.

  50. The more problematic, although, in terms of this case, academic,
      question is whether, if it is shown that a prisoner has not had a
      chance to demonstrate that his continued detention is no longer
      necessary and if, for that reason, that detention constitutes a
      violation of article 5(1) and he is therefore unlawfully detained, he
      must be released.

  51. In James v United Kingdom the ECtHR found that a detention which was
      arbitrary and unlawful could be restored to a condition of lawfulness
      by making accessible the courses whose unavailability were the cause
      of the arbitrary and unlawful detention. What is not completely clear
      from the judgment is whether, during the period that the detention
      was unlawful, the prisoners were entitled to be released.
      Observations made in para 217 of the court's judgment are somewhat
      ambiguous on the question whether release is the automatic
      consequence of a finding of violation of article 5(1):

          "The court acknowledges that the IPP sentence was intended to
          keep in detention those perceived to be dangerous until they
          could show that they were no longer dangerous. The Government
          have suggested that, in these circumstances, a finding of a
          violation of article 5(1) as a result of the lack of access to
          appropriate treatment courses would allow the release of
          dangerous offenders who had not yet addressed their risk factors.
          The court accepts that where an indeterminate sentence has been
          imposed on an individual who was considered by the sentencing
          court to pose a significant risk to the public at large, it would
          be regrettable if his release were ordered before that risk could
          be reduced to a safe level."

  52. It is not immediately obvious whether the court was there indicating
      that such a regrettable eventuality should be avoided or that the
      outcome, although unwelcome, was inescapable. Since there was no
      violation of article 5(1) in this case and it is therefore
      unnecessary to reach a final conclusion on it, I would prefer to
      leave the decision on this vexed question for a future occasion when
      the issue arises directly.

  53. I would dismiss the appeal.

      LORD MANCE (with whom Lord Clarke, Lord Hughes and Lord Toulson
      agree)

  54. I agree that this appeal must be dismissed for the reasons given by
      Lord Kerr.

  55. I add some words on the decision of the Fourth Section of the
      European Court of Human Rights in James v United Kingdom (2013) 56
      EHRR 12, which, as Lord Kerr remarks, leaves at least one question
      problematic.

  56. On a straightforward reading of the European Convention on Human
      Rights, article 5(1) establishes the right to liberty and addresses
      the circumstances in which a person may be deprived of liberty, while
      article 5(4) provides that anyone deprived of his liberty has the
      right to speedy access to court and to a decision whether such
      deprivation was in circumstances permitted under article 5(1).

  57. James, like the present case, concerned prisoners whose detention was
      justified by the authorities on the ground that it constituted "the
      lawful detention of a person after conviction by a competent court"
      within article 5(1)(a). But, after the expiry of their tariff period,
      their continued detention also depended under domestic law upon
      whether or not they could satisfy the Parole Board that such
      detention was no longer necessary for the protection of the public.

  58. In the absence of appropriate available courses, they could not hope
      to satisfy the Parole Board of this. Nonetheless, under the relevant
      domestic law, the result was on the face of it that they remained
      lawfully detained under the original court sentence. Equally, nothing
      was stopping them going to court to test the validity of their
      detention, but it would not on the face of it have done them any good
      to do so. What they could and did in James do was seek by judicial
      review orders that they be provided with the courses that they
      needed.

  59. The House of Lords in James [2010] 1 AC 553 (sub nom R (Walker) v
      Secretary of State for Justice (Parole Board intervening)) recognised
      that prisoners in this invidious position had a public law
      entitlement to such orders by way of judicial review, but held that
      they had no complaint by reference to the Human Rights Convention
      rights. The European Court of Human Rights in finding that the
      circumstances also constituted a cause of complaint under the
      Convention had to locate the violation somewhere in the Convention.
      It located it in article 5(1): see paras 221 and 231 and holding (3).
      It did so on the basis that the detention was "arbitrary and
      therefore unlawful" under article 5(1) during the relevant periods of
      delay - that is, during the periods after expiry of the relevant
      tariffs and before steps were taken to progress the prisoners through
      the system by moving them to "first stage" prisons where courses
      would be available, and also, in the case of Lee, during a subsequent
      period when he was still not offered any course: para 231.

  60. Two further issues were raised before the Court of Human Rights in 
      James, under respectively articles 5(4) and 13. Under article 5(4),
      all three applicants complained that, because "there had been no
      meaningful review of the legality of [the prisoners'] post-tariff
      detention as a result of the failure to operate a system [of courses]
      properly", there had been a violation of article 5(4): para 223. The
      court held that the complaint under article 5(4) gave rise to no
      separate issue, and said that it followed that it could not "make any
      award in respect of the alleged violation of article 5(4)": paras 226
      and 243. It is not clear to me whether or not that means that the
      court thought that article 5(4) had been breached.

  61. The second further issue was raised under article 13 by Mr Wells and
      Mr Lee, but the court regarded article 5(4) as a lex specialis in
      relation to the more general requirements of article 13, and so dealt
      with this issue also under article 5(4): para 229. The complaint was
      that the obstacle under primary legislation to the prisoners' release
      until they satisfied the Parole Board that they were no longer a
      public danger meant that, even if they had succeeded in their
      challenge to their detention, they would not have had any effective
      remedy in respect of the violation: para 224. In dealing with this,
      the court noted that Mr Wells and Mr Lee had been able to commence
      judicial review proceedings to obtain orders that they be provided
      with the relevant courses and that their commencement of such
      proceedings had led to their speedy transfer to first stage prisons
      for that purpose. Accordingly, they had "failed to establish that the
      combination of the Parole Board and judicial review proceedings could
      not have resulted in an order for their release" and, so, there had
      been no violation in this regard: para 232. This reasoning does not
      explicitly address the further five month delay in actually providing
      courses which Mr Lee suffered. But the underlying thinking may again
      be that Mr Lee could have commenced further judicial review
      proceedings which, in combination with the Parole Board's power to
      release once satisfied that he no longer presented a public danger,
      constituted an effective remedy.

  62. The court's reference in James to the detention as "unlawful" under
      article 5(1) during periods when courses were not being duly provided
      is problematic. It suggests that the circumstance identified in
      article 5(1)(a) - that is "the lawful detention of a person after
      conviction by a competent court"  had ceased to exist. If that were
      so, then logically that implies that the prisoner should have been at
      once released. In its forensic endeavour to persuade the Strasbourg
      Court not to find any violation of article 5(1), the United Kingdom
      Government itself suggested that a finding of such a violation would
      "allow [logically, require] the release of dangerous offenders who
      had not yet addressed their risk factors": para 217. The court did
      not face up directly to the logic of this submission, but contented
      itself with saying that "it would be regrettable if . release were
      ordered before that risk could be reduced to a safe level", adding
      only that "However, this does not appear to be the case here": para
      217.

  63. Although the submissions before the court took this extreme form,
      which much of the court's description of the issues echoed (see paras
      175 onwards), I doubt whether it follows axiomatically from the
      court's judgment that a prisoner who was not being given appropriate
      courses could assert a right to release until such courses became
      available. The suggestion that this follows would lose its basis, if
      the court were to be understood as implying into article 5 an
      ancillary duty on the state to provide the courses which would enable
      prisoners to progress towards release in accordance with domestic
      law. That is in substance what the court was doing in, for example,
      para 206, where it said that "it would be irrational to have a policy
      of making release dependent on a prisoner undergoing a treatment
      course without making reasonable provision for such courses".

  64. There are, I think, some other indications in the court's judgment in 
      James that, if the matter had to be decided, the court would not
      expect that prisoners should be released during periods when courses
      were not being duly provided.

  65. First, the court said that the detention was only arbitrary and in
      breach of article 5(1) "during the periods" in which the prisoner
      were not progressed in their sentences (para 231) and that, once they
      had access to relevant courses "their detention once again became
      lawful": para 244. It is difficult to think that the court would
      expect prisoners to be released for a period, eg until appropriate
      first stage prison places and courses were available, and then, by
      some mechanism, recalled.

  66. Second, there is the way in which the court dealt with Mr Wells' and
      Mr Lee's complaint that the pre-condition to their release introduced
      by primary legislation, constituted by the requirement to satisfy the
      Parole Board that they were no longer a public danger, prevented them
      having an effective remedy under article 13. The court said nothing
      to question the legitimacy of this requirement during periods when
      courses were not available. On the contrary, it recited that
      "Pursuant to the 1997 and 2003 Acts, the release of a prisoner
      sentenced to an IPP could be ordered by the Parole Board, having
      satisfied itself that the individual was no longer dangerous": para
      231. It is however true that the court in its further reasoning was
      only concerned with, and accepted, the effectiveness of the judicial
      remedy available through the combination of the Parole Board and the
      judicial review proceedings which Mr Wells and Mr Lee actually took:
      para 232.

  67. Third, I find significant the court's reasoning in rejecting the
      claims to recover in respect of the violation of article 5(1) any
      damages over and above sums for distress and frustration: para 244.
      The court rejected such claims because, it said, it "cannot be
      assumed that, if the violations in the present cases had not
      occurred, the applicants would not have been deprived of their
      liberty": para 244. That reasoning makes good sense, if the
      obligation to progress prisoners towards courses, which could
      facilitate their release, was an obligation ancillary to their
      continued detention. They would not be entitled to release, but they
      could claim damages for the ancillary and "arbitrary" failure to
      enable them to progress towards release. However, any damages claimed
      for loss of liberty (as distinct from damages for distress and
      frustration on account of the delays in providing courses) would
      depend upon showing that, had they been moved earlier to first stage
      prisons and given courses sooner, they would in fact have been
      released sooner. That, the court in effect said, had not been shown,
      and could not "be assumed": para 244.

  68. This explanation of the court's reasoning loses force if the court
      thought that the prisoners should have been released during any
      periods when they were not being duly progressed through the prison
      system. On that basis, the prisoners' continued detention would
      simply be illegitimate, and, as such, damages for wrongful detention
      should follow. It is not normally possible for a public authority,
      after a wrongful arrest or imprisonment, to argue that, if it had not
      been guilty of a wrongful arrest or imprisonment, then it could and
      would have taken different steps which would have achieved a rightful
      arrest or imprisonment. And, even if such an argument were possible,
      the onus would surely be on the public authority to show that it
      could and would have taken those different steps with that result. It
      would not be sufficient to put the onus on the wrongfully detained
      prisoners to show that the public authority could not or would not
      have taken such steps. So the court's statement that it "cannot be
      assumed" (para 244) that the prisoners would not anyway have been
      detained would not have been appropriate.

  69. For these reasons, despite the court's description in para 221 of the
      detention as arbitrary and unlawful under article 5(1), I believe it
      to be well arguable that what was in truth being identified was a
      breach of an ancillary obligation to progress the prisoners through
      the prison system arising by implication from, rather than directly
      under the terms of, article 5(1). Such a breach would not mean that
      the prisoners were entitled to be released, but would entitle them to
      recover any damages which they could show had been suffered as a
      result of that breach. If this were to be regarded as the correct
      analysis, then their continuing detention would continue to be
      legitimate under the Convention as well as under domestic law, until
      the Parole Board was satisfied that their detention was no longer
      necessary for the protection of the public.
